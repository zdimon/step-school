Create sign up form with 3 input fields. Special design is not
required (if you want, you can use Bootstrap 4).

## Requirements

* 3 input fields (email, password, password confirmation).
* use useState or useRef hook for form logic
* after form submitting you should call alert with correct email and password (+6 points)
* email validation: correct pattern, +2 points
* password validation: minimal string length - 6 chars, +2 points
* password confirmation validation, this field must equals to password field, + 2 points
* for validatation you can use npm library [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) or create own regular expressions patterns.
